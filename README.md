# Scenario based questions

*1. A university is developing a student management system where each student*
    *has attributes like name, roll number, and courses enrolled. The system needs*
    *to allow students to perform actions such as enrolling in courses and checking*
    *grades.*
    *Question: Explain the relationship between objects, classes, data members, and*
    *methods in OOP with reference to this system.*

*Ans.*

**In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), classes, objects, data members, and methods are
the core building blocks that help organize and model real-world entities like students in a
university system.**

- *Class: A class is a blueprint for creating student objects. For example, a class named*
    *Student can be created that defines the structure and behaviour of a student. It*
    *includes attributes such as name,* roll_number *, and* courses_enrolled *, and actions*
    *like* enroll_in_course() *or* check_grades().
- *Object: An object is an instance of a class. For example, when a new student joins*
    *the university, a new object of the Student class is created. This object holds the*
    *specific details of that student like their name, roll number, and the list of courses*
    *they are enrolled in.*
- *Data Members: These are the variables inside the class that hold data specific to*
    *each student. In this system, data members can include name,* roll_number *, and*
    courses_enrolled*.*
- *Methods: These are functions defined inside the class that represent the behaviour*
    *of the student. For instance,* enroll_in_course(course_name *) can be a method to*
    *allow a student to enroll in a course, and* check_grades() *can be a method to allow*
    *the student to view their grades.*

*Relationship:*

- *A class groups both data members (attributes like* name *and* courses_enrolled *) and*
    *methods (like* enroll_in_course() *and* check_grades() *).*
- *An object is a specific student created using the class. It uses the structure of the*
    *class to store actual student data and perform actions using the methods defined in*
    *the class.*


**Thus, in the student management system, OOP allows the university to efficiently model
students as objects, define their structure and behaviour in a class, and manage each
student's information and actions in a clean, organized way.**

- *Code:*

#include <iostream>

#include <vector>

#include <string>

using namespace std;

// Class Definition

class Student {

private:

string name; // Data Member

string rollNumber; // Data Member

vector<string> coursesEnrolled; // Data Member

public:

// Constructor

Student(string studentName, string studentRoll) {

name = studentName;

rollNumber = studentRoll;

}

// Method to enroll in a course

void enrollInCourse(string course) {

coursesEnrolled.push_back(course);

cout << name << " has enrolled in " << course << "." << endl;

}


// Method to display student details

void displayDetails() {

cout << "Name: " << name << ", Roll Number: " << rollNumber << endl;

cout << "Courses Enrolled: ";

for (string course : coursesEnrolled) {

cout << course << " ";

}

cout << endl;

}

};

// Main Function

int main() {

// Creating an object (student)

Student student1("Alice", "U123");

// Using methods

student1.enrollInCourse("Mathematics");

student1.enrollInCourse("Physics");

student1.displayDetails();

return 0;

}


*2. A company is designing an employee management system. Some employee*
    *details, such as salary and bank details, should be hidden from other*
    *employees but accessible to HR. Other general details, like name and*
    *department, should be visible to everyone.*
    *Question: How does the private modifier differ from the protected modifier in*
    *OOP, and how can they be used to implement data security in this scenario?*

*Ans.*

*Answer:*

**In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), access specifiers such as private and protected are
used to control the accessibility of class members, and they play a crucial role in
implementing data security in systems like an employee management system.**

*Private Modifier:*

- *Members declared as private can only be accessed within the class itself.*
- *They cannot be accessed directly by any object, function, or derived class.*
- *To access private members, public getter and setter methods are typically used.*
- *This is useful for sensitive data like salary and bank details, which should be hidden*
    *from other employees but accessible to authorized personnel like HR through*
    *controlled functions.*

*Protected Modifier:*

- *Members declared as protected are similar to private but can also be accessed by*
    *derived classes.*
- *This allows for limited visibility where the data is hidden from the outside but*
    *available to specific roles or subclasses, such as an HR class that inherits from the*
    *Employee class.*
- *This is suitable for general information like name and department, which may not*
    *be completely sensitive but should still not be publicly exposed.*

*Application in the Employee Management System:*

- *Use private for salary and bank details to fully encapsulate sensitive data.*


- *Use protected for name and department so HR (as a derived class) can access*
    *them, while keeping them hidden from general access.*
- *Public methods act as interfaces to allow or restrict access to these members in a*
    *controlled manner.*
- *C++ Code Example:*

#include <iostream>

#include <string>

using namespace std;

// Base class: Employee

class Employee {

private:

double salary; // Private: sensitive data

string bankDetails; // Private: sensitive data

protected:

string name; // Protected: visible to HR

string department; // Protected: visible to HR

public:

// Setter for general details

void setGeneralDetails(string empName, string dept) {

name = empName;

department = dept;

}

// Setter for private details


void setPrivateDetails(double empSalary, string bank) {

salary = empSalary;

bankDetails = bank;

}

// Public method to display general info

void displayPublicInfo() {

cout << "Employee Name: " << name << endl;

cout << "Department: " << department << endl;

}

// Getter for sensitive data (used by HR)

double getSalary() {

return salary;

}

string getBankDetails() {

return bankDetails;

}

};

// Derived class: HR

class HR : public Employee {

public:

void viewEmployeeDetails(Employee &emp) {

emp.displayPublicInfo();

cout << "[HR Access] Salary: " << emp.getSalary() << endl;

cout << "[HR Access] Bank Details: " << emp.getBankDetails() << endl;


## }

## };

int main() {

Employee emp1;

emp1.setGeneralDetails("Valmik Sir", "Engineering");

emp1.setPrivateDetails(85000.75, "XYZ Bank, A/C 123456789");

cout << "--- Public View ---" << endl;

emp1.displayPublicInfo();

cout << "\n--- HR View ---" << endl;

HR hrManager;

hrManager.viewEmployeeDetails(emp1);

return 0;

}

*Summary:*

- *The private modifier ensures strict data hiding and is ideal for highly sensitive*
    *information.*
- *The protected modifier allows access within derived classes, enabling controlled*
    *internal access.*
- *Together, they help build secure, well-structured, and role-aware systems by*
    *encapsulating data and limiting access to appropriate classes or functions.*


*3. An e-commerce application allows users to apply different discount coupons.*
    *Some coupons apply a flat discount, while others apply a percentage-based*
    *discount. The system has a method applyDiscount() that behaves differently*
    *based on the type of coupon.*
    *Question: Explain the difference between compile-time polymorphism and*
    **run-time polymorphism with reference to this system.
Ans.
In the context of the e-commerce application where the applyDiscount() method
behaves differently based on the type of coupon (flat discount or percentage-based
discount), we can understand the difference between compile-time polymorphism
and run-time polymorphism using the concepts of method overloading and
method overriding in Java:**


Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)

- *Definition: Method overloading is a type of compile-time polymorphism where*
    *multiple methods have the same name but different parameter lists.*
- *Application in E-commerce System: Suppose the system has multiple*
    *applyDiscount() methods in the same class, but with different parameters like:*

public void applyDiscount(double flatAmount) {

// Apply flat discount

}

public void applyDiscount(double percentage, double totalAmount) {

// Apply percentage-based discount

}


Here, the method to be called is determined at compile-time based on the method
signature used. This improves code readability and allows flexibility within the
same class.

- *Key Characteristics:*


o Happens within the same class.
o Methods must have the same name but different parameters.
o Inheritance is not required.



o Example use: Overloaded versions of applyDiscount() for different discount
types or parameters.


Run-time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)

- *Definition: Method overriding is a type of run-time polymorphism where a subclass*
    *provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its*
    *superclass.*
- *Application in E-commerce System: Suppose there is a base class Coupon and two*
    *subclasses FlatCoupon and PercentageCoupon, each overriding the applyDiscount()*
    *method:*

class Coupon {

public void applyDiscount() {

// Generic implementation

}

}

class FlatCoupon extends Coupon {

@Override

public void applyDiscount() {

// Apply flat discount logic

}

}

class PercentageCoupon extends Coupon {

@Override

public void applyDiscount() {

// Apply percentage discount logic

}

}



Here, the actual method to be called is determined at run-time depending on the
object type (FlatCoupon or PercentageCoupon). This allows behavior to be
dynamically selected at execution time.

- *Key Characteristics:*


o Involves inheritance between classes.
o Methods must have the same name and parameter list.
o Return types must be the same or co-variant.
o Example use: Different coupon types overriding a common applyDiscount()
method in their own way.


Summary Table:


Feature


Method Overloading
(Compile-time
Polymorphism)


Method Overriding (Run-
time Polymorphism)


Method
Signature


Same name, different
parameters


Same name, same
parameters


Binding Time Compile-time Run-time


Inheritance Not required Required


Purpose


Code readability &
flexibility


Custom behavior in
subclass


Example in E-
commerce


Overloaded
applyDiscount() for flat
vs. percentage with
different parameters


Overridden applyDiscount()
in FlatCoupon and
PercentageCoupon
subclasses


So in this e-commerce system, compile-time polymorphism allows different
versions of applyDiscount() to exist in one class, while run-time polymorphism
allows dynamic execution of the correct applyDiscount() logic based on the coupon
type at runtime.


**5. A vehicle rental service provides different rental price calculations based on
vehicle type. Cars have a base price per day, trucks have an additional weight-
based charge, and motorcycles have a mileage-based price.
Question: If a Vehicle class has an abstract method** calculate_rental_price(), **how
would different vehicle types (Car, Truck, Motorcycle) implement it?**

*Ans.*

public class Main {

public static void main(String[] args) {

Vehicle car = new Car();

Vehicle truck = new Truck();

Vehicle motorcycle = new Motorcycle();

System.out.println("Car Rental (3 days): " + car.calculateRentalPrice(3));

System.out.println("Truck Rental (2 days): " + truck.calculateRentalPrice(2));

System.out.println("Motorcycle Rental (4 days): " + motorcycle.calculateRentalPrice(4));

}

}

// Abstract class

abstract class Vehicle {

abstract double calculateRentalPrice(int days);

}

// Car class

class Car extends Vehicle {

@Override

double calculateRentalPrice(int days) {

return days * 500;

}


## }

// Truck class

class Truck extends Vehicle {

@Override

double calculateRentalPrice(int days) {

return days * 1000;

}

}

// Motorcycle class

class Motorcycle extends Vehicle {

@Override

double calculateRentalPrice(int days) {

return days * 300;

}

}


*4. A banking application needs to handle multiple types of exceptions, such as*
    InsufficientFundsException, InvalidAccountException *, and*
    NetworkFailureException*. These exceptions can occur simultaneously when*
    *processing transactions.*
    *Question: How can you handle multiple exceptions in Java to ensure smooth*
    *transaction processing?*

*Ans.*

*How to handle multiple exceptions in Java:*

*1. Use multiple catch blocks*

**Java allows you to write multiple catch blocks after a try block to handle different
exception types individually.**

*2. Order from specific to general*

*Catch the most specific exceptions first, and catch the general Exception type last.*

*3. Use a finally block*

**A finally block is used to perform cleanup actions like closing resources or logging, and it
executes regardless of whether an exception occurred.**

*4. Use custom exception classes*

*Define own exception types.*

- *Code:*
// Main class with main method
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
try {
// Simulate a transaction
processTransaction("ACC123", 15000); // Try changing amount or account for
different exceptions
} catch (InvalidAccountException e) {
System.out.println("Invalid account: " + e.getMessage());
} catch (InsufficientFundsException e) {
System.out.println("Insufficient funds: " + e.getMessage());


} catch (NetworkFailureException e) {

System.out.println("Network failure: " + e.getMessage());

} catch (Exception e) {

System.out.println("Unexpected error: " + e.getMessage());

} finally {

System.out.println("Transaction attempt completed.");

}

}

// Simulate transaction logic

public static void processTransaction(String accountNumber, double amount)

throws InvalidAccountException, InsufficientFundsException,
NetworkFailureException {

if (accountNumber == null || accountNumber.isEmpty()) {

throw new InvalidAccountException("Account number is empty.");

}

if (amount > 10000) {

throw new InsufficientFundsException("Balance is insufficient for the requested
amount.");

}

if (Math.random() < 0.2) {

throw new NetworkFailureException("Unable to connect to the server.");

}

System.out.println("Transaction successful for account: " + accountNumber);

}


## }

// Custom exception: Invalid account

class InvalidAccountException extends Exception {

public InvalidAccountException(String message) {

super(message);

}

}

// Custom exception: Insufficient funds

class InsufficientFundsException extends Exception {

public InsufficientFundsException(String message) {

super(message);

}

}

// Custom exception: Network failure

class NetworkFailureException extends Exception {

public NetworkFailureException(String message) {

super(message);

}

}


*5. Identify and Fix the Error in the Given Code*
    // Interface Animal interface Animal { void makeSound(); } // Interface Cat
    interface Cat { void purr(); } 5) A banking application needs to handle multiple
    types of exceptions, such as InsufficientFundsException, InvalidAccountException,
    and NetworkFailureException. These exceptions can occur simultaneously when
    processing transactions. Question: How can you handle multiple exceptions in
    Java to ensure smooth transaction processing? // Dog class implementing both
    interfaces class Dog extends Animal, Cat { public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Dog barks!"); } public void purr() { } } System.out.println("Dog
    cannot purr, but method must be implemented!"); // Main class public class Main
    { public static void main(String[] args) { Dog dog = new Dog(); dog.makeSound();
    dog.purr(); } }

*Ans.*

*The provided code has a few syntax and structural errors.*

- **Errors :
1. class Dog extends Animal, Cat is invalid syntax.**
    *Reason: In Java, a class can only extend one class, but it can implement*
    *multiple interfaces using the implements keyword.*
    **Fix: Use implements Animal, Cat
2. The System.out.println("Dog cannot purr...") line is placed outside of any method,**
    *which is not allowed in Java.*
       *Fix: Move it inside a method (e.g., purr())*
- *Code:*

// Interface Animal

interface Animal {

void makeSound();

}

// Interface Cat

interface Cat {


void purr();

}

// Dog class implementing both interfaces

class Dog implements Animal, Cat {

public void makeSound() {

System.out.println("Dog barks!");

}

public void purr() {

System.out.println("Dog cannot purr, but method must be implemented!");

}

}

// Main class

public class Main {

public static void main(String[] args) {

Dog dog = new Dog();

dog.makeSound();

dog.purr();

}

}


*6. A flight booking system allows customers to enter their age while booking a*
    *ticket. If the user enters a negative number, the system should throw an*
    *exception. However, missing a required field should cause a different exception.*
    *Question: Differentiate between checked and unchecked exceptions in Java and*
    *explain how they can be used to handle such cases in the flight booking system.*

*Ans.*

**In Java, exceptions are categorized into checked and unchecked exceptions based on how
they are handled at compile time.**

*1. Checked Exceptions*
    - *Definition: Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time. The compiler forces*
       *the programmer to handle them using try-catch or declare them using throws.*
    - *Use in Flight Booking System:*
       *A missing required field (like name or passport number) is a recoverable and*
       *predictable error, so it should be handled as a checked exception.*

*Example:*

class MissingFieldException extends Exception {

public MissingFieldException(String message) {

super(message);

}

}

*2. Unchecked Exceptions*
    - *Definition: Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time. They are*
       *subclasses of RuntimeException and usually occur due to programming errors (e.g.,*
       *logic issues).*
    - *Use in Flight Booking System:*
       *Entering a negative age is a logic error, which can be treated as an unchecked*
       *exception because it should not happen under normal conditions.*

*Example:*

class InvalidAgeException extends RuntimeException {

public InvalidAgeException(String message) {


super(message);

}

}

- *Code:*

// Custom checked exception for missing required fields

class MissingFieldException extends Exception {

public MissingFieldException(String message) {

super(message);

}

}

// Custom unchecked exception for invalid input like negative age

class InvalidAgeException extends RuntimeException {

public InvalidAgeException(String message) {

super(message);

}

}

public class Main {

// Flight booking method

public static void bookTicket(String name, int age) throws MissingFieldException {

if (name == null || name.isEmpty()) {

throw new MissingFieldException("Name is required.");

}

if (age < 0) {


throw new InvalidAgeException("Age cannot be negative.");

}

System.out.println("Ticket booked for " + name + ", Age: " + age);

}

// Main method

public static void main(String[] args) {

try {

// Try different test cases:

// bookTicket("", 25); // Will throw MissingFieldException

// bookTicket("Alice", -5); // Will throw InvalidAgeException

bookTicket("Alice", 30); // Successful booking

} catch (MissingFieldException e) {

System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());

} catch (InvalidAgeException e) {

System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());

}

}

}

*Difference:*


Feature Checked Exception Unchecked Exception


Checked at compile
time Yes^ No^


Inheritance Extends Exception Extends RuntimeException



Feature Checked Exception Unchecked Exception


Example IOException,
MissingFieldException


ArithmeticException,
InvalidAgeException


Flight System Use Missing required input Invalid logical input (like negative
age)

*7. What will happen if an exception occurs and there is no catch block?*

*Ans.*

**If an exception occurs and there is no catch block to handle it, the following will happen in
Java:**

*1. The program will terminate abnormally*
    - *Java will not know how to handle the exception, so it will stop program execution*
       **at the point where the exception occurred.
2. Java will throw a default exception message**
    - *The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) will print a stack trace showing:*
       o *Type of exception*
       o *Error message (if any)*
       o *Line number where the error occurred*
       o *The call stack leading to the error*
    - *Example Code:*

public class Main {

public static void main(String[] args) {

int a = 10;

int b = 0;

int result = a / b; // This will throw ArithmeticException


System.out.println("Result: " + result); // This line won't run

}

}

*8. A software development company is working on an employee attendance*
    *system. Each employee has a unique ID and login time. The system initializes*
    *employee details when they log in and provides methods to retrieve and*
    *update their attendance data.*
    *Question: What is the difference between a method and a constructor in OOP?*
    **Explain with reference to the employee attendance system.
Ans.
Here's a precise and well-structured answer to your question, with reference to the
employee attendance system and using the provided comparison chart:**


Q: What is the difference between a method and a constructor in OOP? Explain
with reference to the employee attendance system.
In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), constructors and methods serve different
purposes. Here's a detailed comparison using the employee attendance system as
context:


Constructors Methods


A constructor is a block of code
used to initialize a newly created
object.


A method is a block of code that
performs operations and may return a
value.


It is called automatically when an
object is created using new.


It must be explicitly called by the
programmer.


It has no return type, not even void. It must have a return type (e.g., void,
int, String).


The name must match the class
name.


The name can be any valid identifier.



Constructors Methods


It sets up the object’s initial state. It performs actions on an already
created object.


Constructors cannot be inherited. Methods can be inherited and
overridden in subclasses.

- *Example in the Employee Attendance System:*

// Employee class

class Employee {

String employeeId;

String loginTime;

// Constructor - called automatically when an object is created

public Employee(String id, String loginTime) {

this.employeeId = id;

this.loginTime = loginTime;

}

// Method - retrieves login details

public String getLoginDetails() {

return "Employee ID: " + employeeId + ", Login Time: " + loginTime;

}

// Method - updates login time

public void updateLoginTime(String newLoginTime) {

this.loginTime = newLoginTime;

}

}


// Main class

public class Main {

public static void main(String[] args) {

// Creating an employee object using the constructor

Employee emp = new Employee("EMP123", "09:00 AM");

// Display initial login details

System.out.println(emp.getLoginDetails());

// Update login time using a method

emp.updateLoginTime("09:30 AM");

// Display updated login details

System.out.println(emp.getLoginDetails());

}

}

- *The constructor* Employee(String id, String loginTime *) is automatically called when*
    *an employee logs in to create a new Employee object with their ID and login time.*
- *The methods like* getLoginDetails() *and* updateLoginTime() *are used after the object*
    *is created to retrieve or update attendance data.*


In the attendance system, constructors are used to initialize each employee's data
at login, while methods are used to manage and manipulate that data afterward.
Both are essential but serve distinct roles in OOP design.


*9. A bank application stores customer account details securely. The account*
    *balance should not be directly accessible but can be retrieved or updated using*
    *specific methods. Question: Explain how getter and setter methods contribute*
    *to encapsulation. Provide a code example demonstrating how they can be used*
    **in this banking scenario.
Ans.
Encapsulation in Java means wrapping data (variables) and code (methods)
together as a single unit and restricting direct access to some components.
In a bank application, account details like balance should be private and only
accessible via getter and setter methods. This protects the data from unauthorized
or incorrect access.**


Role of Getter and Setter Methods:


Method Type Purpose


getter Safely retrieve private data


setter Safely update private data with validation logic

- *Java Code:*


// BankAccount class with encapsulation
class BankAccount {
private String accountNumber;
private double balance;


// Constructor
public BankAccount(String accountNumber, double initialBalance) {
this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
this.balance = initialBalance;
}


// Getter method for balance


public double getBalance() {

return balance;

}

// Setter method for balance (with validation)

public void setBalance(double newBalance) {

if (newBalance >= 0) {

balance = newBalance;

} else {

System.out.println("Invalid balance. Cannot set a negative value.");

}

}

// Method to display account info

public void displayAccountInfo() {

System.out.println("Account: " + accountNumber + ", Balance: " + balance);

}

}

// Main class to test

public class Main {

public static void main(String[] args) {

// Create a new bank account

BankAccount acc = new BankAccount("123456789", 1000.0);

// Display initial account info

acc.displayAccountInfo();



// Try to update balance using setter
acc.setBalance(1500.0); // Valid update
System.out.println("Updated Balance: " + acc.getBalance());


acc.setBalance(-500); // Invalid update
System.out.println("After invalid update attempt: " + acc.getBalance());
}
}


Explanation:

- *The balance field is private, so it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.*
- *The getBalance() method returns the current balance.*
- *The setBalance() method updates the balance, but only if the new value is valid*
    *(non-negative).*
- *This ensures secure and controlled access to sensitive data, which is the core idea*
    *of encapsulation.*
    *10. A university wants to model its staff hierarchy. A Professor is a type of*
       *Employee, and a Department has multiple Professors. Question: Describe the*
       *"is-a" and "has-a" relationships in OOP with reference to this scenario. Provide*
       *an example for each.*

*Ans.*

*"is-a" Relationship (Inheritance)*

- *The "is-a" relationship in OOP refers to inheritance.*
- *It means one class is a specialized version of another.*
- *In your scenario:*
    *→ A Professor* *is a* *type of Employee*

*Example:*


// Superclass

class Employee {

String name;

int id;

Employee(String name, int id) {

this.name = name;

this.id = id;

}

void displayInfo() {

System.out.println("Employee ID: " + id + ", Name: " + name);

}

}

// Subclass - Inherits from Employee

class Professor extends Employee {

String subject;

Professor(String name, int id, String subject) {

super(name, id);

this.subject = subject;

}

void teach() {

System.out.println(name + " teaches " + subject);

}

}


*In this example, Professor extends Employee, so Professor is-a Employee.*

*"has-a" Relationship (Composition/Aggregation)*

- *The "has-a" relationship represents composition or aggregation.*
- *One class contains or uses another class.*
- *In your scenario:*
    *→ A Department* *has-a* *list of Professors*

*Example:*

import java.util.ArrayList;

import java.util.List;

class Department {

String name;

List<Professor> professors;

Department(String name) {

this.name = name;

this.professors = new ArrayList<>();

}

void addProfessor(Professor p) {

professors.add(p);

}

void listProfessors() {

System.out.println("Department: " + name);

for (Professor p : professors) {

p.displayInfo();


p.teach();

}

}

}

**In this example, Department has-a list of Professor objects, forming a has-a
relationship.**

- *Code:*
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;


// Superclass: Employee
class Employee {
String name;
int id;


Employee(String name, int id) {
this.name = name;
this.id = id;
}


void displayInfo() {
System.out.println("Employee ID: " + id + ", Name: " + name);
}
}


// Subclass: Professor is-a Employee
class Professor extends Employee {


String subject;

Professor(String name, int id, String subject) {

super(name, id);

this.subject = subject;

}

void teach() {

System.out.println(name + " teaches " + subject);

}

}

// Department class has-a list of Professors

class Department {

String name;

List<Professor> professors;

Department(String name) {

this.name = name;

this.professors = new ArrayList<>();

}

void addProfessor(Professor p) {

professors.add(p);

}

void listProfessors() {

System.out.println("Department: " + name);


for (Professor p : professors) {

p.displayInfo();

p.teach();

System.out.println();

}

}

}

// Main class

public class Main {

*11. A game development team is using both C++ and Java to design a game engine.*
    *They notice that Java requires interface and implements keywords, while C++*
    *does not.*
    *Question: Why does C++ not require the interface or implements keyword like*
    *Java? Explain with a code example.*

*Ans.*

*Short Answer:*

**C++ does not require the interface or implements keywords because it uses abstract
classes to define interfaces.
In C++, an abstract class (a class with at least one pure virtual function) can act as an
interface.
Any class that inherits from it and overrides the pure virtual functions is considered to
have implemented the interface.**

**In contrast, Java explicitly uses interface and implements keywords to define and use
interfaces.**

- **C++ vs Java Interface Example:
Java Example:**

interface GameEntity {

void update();

}

class Player implements GameEntity {

public void update() {


System.out.println("Player updated.");

}

}

- *Equivalent C++ Example:*

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Abstract class acting as an interface

class GameEntity {

public:

virtual void update() = 0; // Pure virtual function

virtual ~GameEntity() {} // Virtual destructor

};

// Class implementing the interface

class Player : public GameEntity {

public:

void update() override {

cout << "Player updated." << endl;

}

};

int main() {

GameEntity* entity = new Player();

entity->update();

delete entity;

return 0;

}


- *Explanation:*


Java C++


Uses interface and implements Uses abstract class with pure virtual function


Syntax is explicit Syntax is implicit (via = 0 pure virtual)


Interfaces can't have fields Abstract class can have fields


Multiple inheritance via interfaces is
allowed


Multiple inheritance of abstract classes is
allowed

*Conclusion:*

**C++ doesn't need special keywords like interface or implements because its powerful
inheritance model allows any class with pure virtual functions to behave like an interface.
This makes C++ more flexible, though less explicit than Java.**

*12. A social media platform is implementing user profiles. Some details, such as*
    *username and profile picture, are visible to everyone, while other details, like*
    *contact number and email, are hidden and can only be accessed via a request*
    *system.*
    *Question: What is the difference between Encapsulation and Abstraction in*
    *OOP? How would you use these concepts to design the privacy settings in this*
    *social media application?*

*Ans.*

*Key Difference: Encapsulation vs Abstraction*


Feature Encapsulation (Data Hiding) Abstraction


Definition


Hiding internal data and allowing
access only through methods


Hiding implementation details and
showing only essential features


Purpose


Protect data from unauthorized
access Simplify design and interaction^



Feature Encapsulation (Data Hiding) Abstraction


Implementation Using private fields +
getters/setters


Using abstract classes or interfaces


Focus How data is protected What the system does

*Example: Social Media Privacy*

*In a social media app, user profile data can be:*

- *Public (e.g., username, profile picture) → visible to all*
- *Private (e.g., contact number, email) → accessible only via request*

*Using Encapsulation:*

**Encapsulation is used to hide sensitive data like contact number or email, allowing
controlled access.**

class UserProfile {

private String username;

private String profilePicture;

private String contactNumber; // private

private String email; // private

public UserProfile(String username, String profilePicture, String contactNumber, String
email) {

this.username = username;

this.profilePicture = profilePicture;

this.contactNumber = contactNumber;

this.email = email;

}

// Public getters for visible info


public String getUsername() {

return username;

}

public String getProfilePicture() {

return profilePicture;

}

// Controlled access via request

public String requestContactInfo(boolean isAuthorized) {

if (isAuthorized) {

return contactNumber;

} else {

return "Access denied";

}

}

public String requestEmail(boolean isAuthorized) {

if (isAuthorized) {

return email;

} else {

return "Access denied";

}

}

}

*Using Abstraction:*


**Abstraction is used to define what operations can be done, without showing how they are
done.
You might define an abstract interface for access control or profile visibility.**

interface ProfilePrivacy {

String getPublicInfo();

String getPrivateInfo(boolean isAuthorized);

}

class BasicUserProfile implements ProfilePrivacy {

private UserProfile profile;

public BasicUserProfile(UserProfile profile) {

this.profile = profile;

}

public String getPublicInfo() {

return "Username: " + profile.getUsername() +

"\nProfile Picture: " + profile.getProfilePicture();

}

public String getPrivateInfo(boolean isAuthorized) {

return "Email: " + profile.requestEmail(isAuthorized) +

"\nContact: " + profile.requestContactInfo(isAuthorized);

}

}

- *Code :*


// Class to demonstrate Encapsulation


class UserProfile {
private String username;
private String profilePicture;
private String contactNumber;
private String email;


public UserProfile(String username, String profilePicture, String contactNumber, String
email) {
this.username = username;
this.profilePicture = profilePicture;
this.contactNumber = contactNumber;
this.email = email;
}


// Public getters for non-sensitive info
public String getUsername() {
return username;
}


public String getProfilePicture() {
return profilePicture;
}


// Controlled access to private info
public String getContactNumber(boolean isAuthorized) {
if (isAuthorized) {
return contactNumber;


} else {

return "Access denied";

}

}

public String getEmail(boolean isAuthorized) {

if (isAuthorized) {

return email;

} else {

return "Access denied";

}

}

}

// Interface to demonstrate Abstraction

interface ProfilePrivacy {

String getPublicInfo();

String getPrivateInfo(boolean isAuthorized);

}

// Class implementing the abstraction

class BasicUserProfile implements ProfilePrivacy {

private UserProfile profile;

public BasicUserProfile(UserProfile profile) {

this.profile = profile;

}


public String getPublicInfo() {

return "Username: " + profile.getUsername()

+ "\nProfile Picture: " + profile.getProfilePicture();

}

public String getPrivateInfo(boolean isAuthorized) {

return "Email: " + profile.getEmail(isAuthorized)

+ "\nContact: " + profile.getContactNumber(isAuthorized);

}

}

// Main class to run the program

public class Main {

public static void main(String[] args) {

UserProfile user = new UserProfile("john_doe", "profile.jpg", "123- 456 - 7890",
"john@example.com");

BasicUserProfile profileView = new BasicUserProfile(user);

System.out.println("=== Public Info ===");

System.out.println(profileView.getPublicInfo());

System.out.println("\n=== Private Info (Unauthorized) ===");

System.out.println(profileView.getPrivateInfo(false));

System.out.println("\n=== Private Info (Authorized) ===");

System.out.println(profileView.getPrivateInfo(true));

}

}


*Summary:*

- *Encapsulation is used to protect sensitive profile data (email, phone) via private*
    *fields and access methods.*
- *Abstraction is used to provide a clean, simple interface (ProfilePrivacy) to the rest*
    *of the app, hiding how access is managed.*
    *13. A student information system needs to store student records in a file. It should*
       *allow reading student details when needed and updating them efficiently.*
       *Question: Explain how to read and write files in C++ using fstream. Provide an*
       *example of how the student information system could implement this feature.*
    *Ans.*
    *Explanation:*
    *In C++, you can use the <fstream> header for file operations:*
- *ofstream → for writing to files*
- *ifstream → for reading from files*
- *fstream → for both reading and writing*
- *C++ Example: Student Record File Handling*
    **This program:
1. Writes student data to a file.
2. Reads the data from the file.
3. Updates student records (by rewriting the file).**
- *Code:*
    #include <iostream>


#include <sstream>

#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Student {

public:

string name;

int roll;

float marks;

void inputData() {

cout << "Enter Name: ";

getline(cin, name);

cout << "Enter Roll Number: ";

cin >> roll;

cout << "Enter Marks: ";

cin >> marks;

cin.ignore();

}

void displayData() const {

cout << "Name: " << name << ", Roll: " << roll << ", Marks: " << marks << endl;

}

string toCSV() const {

return name + "," + to_string(roll) + "," + to_string(marks);

}


static Student fromCSV(const string& line) {

Student s;

stringstream ss(line);

getline(ss, s.name, ',');

string rollStr, marksStr;

getline(ss, rollStr, ',');

getline(ss, marksStr, ',');

s.roll = stoi(rollStr);

s.marks = stof(marksStr);

return s;

}

};

// Simulate a file using a vector of strings

vector<string> fakeFileStorage;

void writeStudentRecord() {

Student s;

s.inputData();

fakeFileStorage.push_back(s.toCSV());

cout << "Student record added.\n";

}

void readStudentRecords() {

cout << "\n--- All Student Records ---\n";

if (fakeFileStorage.empty()) {

cout << "No records found.\n";

return;


## }

for (const string& line : fakeFileStorage) {

Student s = Student::fromCSV(line);

s.displayData();

}

}

int main() {

int choice;

do {

cout << "\n1. Add Student\n2. View All Students\n0. Exit\nEnter your choice: ";

cin >> choice;

cin.ignore(); // consume newline after number input

switch (choice) {

case 1:

writeStudentRecord();

break;

case 2:

readStudentRecords();

break;

case 0:

cout << "Exiting...\n";

break;

default:

cout << "Invalid choice.\n";

}



} while (choice != 0);


return 0;
}


How it works:

- *Writing: Appends new student records in the format name,roll,marks to the file.*
- *Reading: Reads and displays all student records line by line.*
- *Updating: For real-world use, update logic would involve reading into memory,*
    *modifying, and rewriting the file.*
    *14. Identify and Fix the Error in the Given Code public class ExceptionExample {*
       *public static void main(String[] args) { try { int num = 5 / 0; } catch () {*
       *System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero"); } } }*

*Ans.*

**The error in your code is in the catch block. In Java, a catch block must specify the type of
exception it is catching.**

- *Problem:*

catch () { *// Missing exception type*

- *Fix:*

*Add the specific exception type you want to handle—* ArithmeticException **for divide-by-
zero:**

- *Correct Code:*


public class ExceptionExample {

public static void main(String[] args) {

try {

int num = 5 / 0;

}

catch (ArithmeticException e) {

System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero");

}

}

}

*15. A payment gateway processes multiple types of transactions. While executing a*
    *transaction, different exceptions may occur, such as*
    InsufficientBalanceException, InvalidCardException, *or*
    TransactionTimeoutException*. The system must handle all these exceptions to*
    *ensure smooth transactions.*
    *Question: How can multiple exceptions be handled in Java to make sure the*
    *payment gateway runs without failure? Provide a suitable example.*

*Ans.*

*In Java, multiple exceptions can be handled using either:*

**1. Multiple catch blocks – one for each exception type.
2. Multi-catch block – handle several exceptions in one catch.**
- *Example: Handling Multiple Exceptions in a Payment Gateway*

public class PaymentExample {

// Custom Exceptions as inner classes

static class InsufficientBalanceException extends Exception {


public InsufficientBalanceException(String message) {

super(message);

}

}

static class InvalidCardException extends Exception {

public InvalidCardException(String message) {

super(message);

}

}

static class TransactionTimeoutException extends Exception {

public TransactionTimeoutException(String message) {

super(message);

}

}

// Transaction Processing Class

static class PaymentGateway {

public void processTransaction(String cardNumber, double balance)

throws InsufficientBalanceException, InvalidCardException,
TransactionTimeoutException {

if (cardNumber == null || cardNumber.length() != 16) {

throw new InvalidCardException("Card number is invalid.");

}

if (balance < 1000) {


throw new InsufficientBalanceException("Insufficient balance.");

}

if (Math.random() > 0.7) { // Simulate a timeout randomly

throw new TransactionTimeoutException("Transaction timed out.");

}

System.out.println("Transaction successful!");

}

}

// Main method

public static void main(String[] args) {

PaymentGateway gateway = new PaymentGateway();

// Test values

String cardNumber = "1234567890123456";

double balance = 800; // Change to 1500 to simulate success

try {

gateway.processTransaction(cardNumber, balance);

} catch (InvalidCardException e) {

System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());

} catch (InsufficientBalanceException e) {

System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());

} catch (TransactionTimeoutException e) {

System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());

} finally {


System.out.println("Transaction attempt completed.");

}

}

}

*Key Concepts:*

- *Custom exceptions allow you to represent real-world issues in code.*
- *Each catch handles a specific type of error.*
- *finally ensures cleanup or final messaging, regardless of success or failure.*
    *16. A hospital management system stores patient records. Each patient has a*
       *unique ID, name, and medical history. The system should allow doctors to*
       *create and access patient records efficiently.*
       *Question: What is the difference between a Class and an Object in OOP?*
       *Explain using this hospital management system as an example.*

*Ans.*

*Conceptual Explanation:*


Class Object


A class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a
class.


It defines attributes (like ID, name, history) and
behaviors (like create or access records).


It holds actual data for a specific
patient.


No memory is allocated for a class by itself. Memory is allocated when the
object is created.


In the hospital system, Patient is a class. patient1, patient2 are objects of
that class.

- *Java Code:*


class Patient {

int id;

String name;

String medicalHistory;

// Constructor

public Patient(int id, String name, String medicalHistory) {

this.id = id;

this.name = name;

this.medicalHistory = medicalHistory;

}

// Method to display patient details

public void displayRecord() {

System.out.println("Patient ID: " + id);

System.out.println("Name: " + name);

System.out.println("Medical History: " + medicalHistory);

}

}

// Main class with main() method

public class Main {

public static void main(String[] args) {

// Creating patient objects

Patient patient1 = new Patient(1, "Rahul Sharma", "Allergy to penicillin");

Patient patient2 = new Patient(2, "Meera Joshi", "Asthma, High BP");

// Displaying patient records


System.out.println("=== Patient 1 Record ===");

patient1.displayRecord();

System.out.println("\n=== Patient 2 Record ===");

patient2.displayRecord();

}

}

*Summary:*

- *Patient class defines what a patient is (structure).*
- *patient1 and patient2 are actual records stored and used in the system.*
    *17. A company is developing a role-based access control system where different*
       *users have different levels of access. Admin can modify and delete data,*
       *Manager can view and edit, while Employees can only view certain details.*
       *Question: Create a comparison table of access modifiers (private, protected,*
       *public, and default) and explain how they can be used in this system to restrict*
       *access appropriately.*

*Ans.*

- *Access Modifiers Comparison Table:*


Context Default Private Protected Public


Same Class Yes Yes Yes Yes


Same Package Subclass Yes No Yes Yes


Same Package Non-Subclass Yes No Yes Yes


Different Package Subclass No No Yes Yes


Different Package Non-Subclass No No No Yes


*How Access Modifiers Can Be Used in This System*

*1. Admin (Full Access)*
    - *Can access and modify private/protected data via public admin methods.*
    - **Admin methods are declared as public.
2. Manager (View + Edit)**
    - *Inherits from a base user class with protected edit methods.*
    - **Restricted from using private data or delete functions.
3. Employee (View Only)**
    - *Only has access to public view methods.*
    - *Cannot access protected or private operations.*
    - *Java code:*

class UserData {

private String confidentialData = "Secret";

protected void editData() {

System.out.println("Editing data...");

}

public void viewData() {

System.out.println("Viewing data...");

}

private void deleteData() {

System.out.println("Deleting data... (Admin only)");

}

}


class Manager extends UserData {

public void accessFeatures() {

viewData(); // Allowed

editData(); // Allowed (protected)

// deleteData(); // Not allowed (private)

}

}

class Employee extends UserData {

public void accessFeatures() {

viewData(); // Allowed

// editData(); // Not allowed (protected)

}

}

public class Main {

public static void main(String[] args) {

Manager manager = new Manager();

manager.accessFeatures();

Employee employee = new Employee();

employee.accessFeatures();

}

}


*18. A robotics startup is using C++ and Java to develop a robotic arm control*
    *system. While coding the interfaces for different sensors, they observe that Java*
    *requires interface and implements keywords, whereas C++ does not.*
    *Question: Why does C++ not require the interface or implements keyword like*
    *Java? Explain with a code example.*

*Ans.*

**Sure. Here's a clear explanation without emojis, along with the code examples in both Java
and C++.**

*Question: Why does C++ not require the interface or implements keyword like Java?*

*Explanation:*

- *Java is a purely object-oriented language. It does not support multiple inheritance*
    *of classes to avoid ambiguity. Therefore, Java introduced interfaces as a way to*
    *allow a class to inherit behavior from multiple sources without inheriting*
    *implementation.*
       o *Interfaces in Java are defined using the interface keyword.*
       o *Classes implement them using the implements keyword.*
- *C++, on the other hand, supports multiple inheritance. You can use abstract classes*
    *with pure virtual functions to define an interface-like structure.*
       o *There is no need for special keywords like interface or implements.*
       o *A class with one or more pure virtual functions acts like an interface.*
- *Java Example (Using interface and implements):*

// Sensor.java

interface Sensor {

void readData();

}

// TemperatureSensor.java

class TemperatureSensor implements Sensor {

public void readData() {


System.out.println("Reading temperature data...");

}

}

public class Main {

public static void main(String[] args) {

Sensor sensor = new TemperatureSensor();

sensor.readData();

}

}

- *C++ Example (Using Abstract Class with Pure Virtual Function):*

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Abstract base class (acts like an interface)

class Sensor {

public:

virtual void readData() = 0; // Pure virtual function

};

// Concrete class implementing the interface

class TemperatureSensor : public Sensor {

public:

void readData() override {

cout << "Reading temperature data..." << endl;

}

};


int main() {

Sensor* sensor = new TemperatureSensor();

sensor->readData();

delete sensor;

return 0;

}

*19. A school management system has a Student class that inherits from the Person*
    *class. The Person class has a method getDetails(), which returns basic*
    *information, but the Student class needs to provide additional student specific*
    *details.*
    *Question: How do the super and this keywords work in Java? Explain their use*
    *in this school management system.*

*Ans.*

*In Java, the keywords super and this are used to differentiate between:*


- *super: Refers to the parent class (superclass).*
- *this: Refers to the current class (subclass).*

*Use in a School Management System*

*In this system:*

- *The Person class has a method* getDetails() *that returns general info.*
- *The Student class inherits from Person and overrides* getDetails() *to add more*
    *information.*
- *The super keyword is used in Student to call the* getDetails() *method from Person.*
- *The this keyword can be used to refer to instance variables when needed.*
- *Java Code :*

// Superclass

class Person {

String name;

int age;

Person(String name, int age) {

this.name = name; // 'this' refers to current object’s variables

this.age = age;

}

String getDetails() {

return "Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age;

}

}

// Subclass


class Student extends Person {

String studentId;

Student(String name, int age, String studentId) {

super(name, age); // 'super' calls parent constructor

this.studentId = studentId; // 'this' refers to the current class’s variable

}

*20. A vehicle rental management system allows customers to rent vehicles.*
    *Customers can specify rental duration, vehicle type, or even add extra services*
    *like insurance.*
    *Question: How would you implement method overloading for a rent_vehicle()*
    *method to support different customer needs? Provide an example.*

*Ans.*

*Concept:*

- *Method Overloading: Multiple methods with the same name but different*
    *parameters.*
- *This allows customers to rent a vehicle by specifying:*
    o *Only vehicle type*
    o *Vehicle type + rental duration*
    o *Vehicle type + rental duration + extra service*
- Java *Code:*

class RentalService {

// Rent by vehicle type

void rentVehicle(String vehicleType) {

System.out.println("Renting a " + vehicleType);

}

// Rent by vehicle type and duration

void rentVehicle(String vehicleType, int duration) {


System.out.println("Renting a " + vehicleType + " for " + duration + " days.");

}

// Rent by vehicle type, duration, and extra service

void rentVehicle(String vehicleType, int duration, boolean insurance) {

System.out.println("Renting a " + vehicleType + " for " + duration + " days.");

if (insurance) {

System.out.println("Insurance service added.");

} else {

System.out.println("No insurance added.");

}

}

}

public class Main {

public static void main(String[] args) {

*21. A banking application processes transactions. If an error occurs, such as*
    *insufficient funds or invalid account number, the system should handle it*
    *gracefully instead of crashing.*
    *Question: Define Exception Handling and Error Handling and explain how they*
    *help in building reliable banking applications.*

*Ans.*

- *Difference Between Exception Handling and Error Handling*


Aspect Exception Handling Error Handling


Definition


A mechanism to handle runtime
anomalies (e.g., invalid input, database
connection issues).


A broader term that includes
exception handling and system-
level faults.


Scope Deals with issues in the program’s logic
or flow.


Can also deal with critical
system-level issues (e.g.,
memory overflow).


Recoverable? Most exceptions are recoverable.


Many errors (like hardware
failure) are not recoverable.


Handled using try, catch, finally, throw, and throws in
Java.


May involve low-level
diagnostics, logs, alerts, or
shutting down safely.


Usage in
Banking


To manage failed transactions, login
errors, insufficient funds, etc.


To detect major system failures,
out-of-memory errors, etc.

*How They Help in a Banking Application*

- *Exception Handling:*
    o *Ensures smooth user experience by catching issues like:*
       ▪ *Invalid account number*
       ▪ *Insufficient balance*
       ▪ *Transaction timeout*
    o *Prevents crashes and allows showing user-friendly error messages.*
- *Error Handling:*



o Ensures the system handles critical errors such as:
▪ File system failure
▪ Server outage
▪ Memory leaks
o May involve system rebooting, logging, and recovery procedures.

- *Java code:*

class BankTransaction {

void processTransaction(String accountNumber, double balance, double amount) {

try {

if (accountNumber == null || accountNumber.isEmpty()) {

throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid account number.");

}

if (amount > balance) {

throw new Exception("Insufficient funds.");

}

System.out.println("Transaction successful. Withdrawn: ₹" + amount);

} catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {

System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());

} catch (Exception e) {

System.out.println("Transaction failed: " + e.getMessage());

} finally {

System.out.println("Transaction attempt completed.");

}

}

}


public class Main {

public static void main(String[] args) {

BankTransaction bt = new BankTransaction();

bt.processTransaction("", 5000, 2000); // Invalid account

bt.processTransaction("ACC123", 1000, 2000); // Insufficient funds

bt.processTransaction("ACC123", 5000, 3000); // Success

}

}

*Conclusion:*

- *Exception handling provides fault tolerance and better user interaction.*
- *Error handling ensures system reliability and resilience.*
- *Both are essential in a secure and reliable banking application.*
    *22. Identify and Fix the Error in the Given Code class Student { private int age = 20;*
       *} public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { Student s = new*
       *Student(); System.out.println(s.age); } }*
    *Ans.*
    *The error in this code is due to accessing a private member (age) of the Student*
    *class directly from outside the class, which is not allowed in Java.*


Fix: Use a getter method to access the private field.

- *corrected code:*
    class Student {
    private int age = 20;


// Getter method to access private variable



public int getAge() {
return age;
}
}


public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Student s = new Student();
System.out.println("Student age: " + s.getAge());
}
}

*23. A flight booking system allows customers to book tickets. If an invalid seat*
    *number is entered, the system should immediately generate an exception.*
    *However, some exceptions, like invalid passport numbers, should be declared in*
    *the method signature for the calling function to handle.*
    *Question: What is the difference between throw and throws in Java? Explain*
    *with reference to this flight booking system.*

*Ans.*

- *Key Differences Between throw and throws:*


Feature throw throws


Purpose Used to actually throw an
exception


Declares that a method might
throw an exception


Placement Inside the method body In the method declaration


Used With An instance of an exception (e.g.,
new Exception())


Exception class names



Feature throw throws


Number of
Exceptions


One at a time Can declare multiple exceptions,
comma-separated

- *Code:*

class BookingSystem {

// Method that checks seat number and throws an exception

void bookSeat(int seatNumber) {

*Summary:*

- *Use throw to actually throw an exception (e.g., invalid seat).*
- *Use throws in method signature to declare an exception that the caller must handle*
    *(e.g., invalid passport).*
